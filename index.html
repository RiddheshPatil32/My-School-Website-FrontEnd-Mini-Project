         <p  id="rightb" id="imp">St. Xavier’s education society is the only catholic education organization (in Mahad and it’s vicinity) established in Mahad which has a negligible Christian population. We the management of St. Xavier’s education society associated with the intention of catering to the quality education needs of the community. While we were working with different schools in Mahad, there was a constant demand from the local people for a ‘Catholic school ‘, which are often known for their quality and dedicated services. This support and demand of people led St. Xavier’s school to emerge and flourish to the present status.</p>
